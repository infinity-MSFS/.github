# Infinity MSFS

Welcome to **Infinity** — a development studio and technology platform dedicated to delivering high-fidelity aircraft systems and next-generation tooling for Microsoft Flight Simulator (2024).

We build both the Infinity **Manager ecosystem** (installation, updates, configuration, licensing, and developer integration) and premium WASM modules / avionics systems for commercial MSFS aircraft, pushing far beyond the default limitations of the simulator.



## What We Build

### Infinity Manager

A unified ecosystem for MSFS add-ons. Infinity Manager streamlines the full lifecycle of an aircraft or add-on:

- Purchasing & entitlement
- Installation & file management
- Updates & patching
- Configuration & module integration
- Developer distribution workflows

### TacLink

TacLink is a high-performance multiplayer and networking framework engineered for military simulation, enabling features such as:

- Air-to-air TACAN
- Synchronized radar and sensors
- AAR (air-to-air refueling) support
- Combat and mission systems synchronization
- Shared state and deterministic behavior across sessions

### Infinity DRM

Infinity DRM is a secure, MSFS-optimized licensing and distribution layer that helps studios ship payware aircraft safely without sacrificing user experience.

### WASM Systems Development

Infinity designs and implements top-tier WASM modules for payware aircraft, including:

- Advanced avionics and navigation suites
- Custom displays and instrument systems
- Aircraft electrical / hydraulic / fuel / FADEC and other deep systems
- High-performance, maintainable codebases built for long-term support___

### Technology Stack

- C++ (14/26): Primary language for systems, avionics, and performance-critical modules.
- Rust: Networking services, backend infrastructure, concurrency-heavy tooling, and platform utilities.
- TypeScript / Python / Lua: UI, automation, scripting, and specialized tooling where higher-level iteration speed matters.
